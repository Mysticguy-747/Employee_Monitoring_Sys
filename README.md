- **Screenshots**: Captures and saves screenshots at regular intervals.
- **Time Zone Changes**: Detects and logs changes in the system's time zone.
- **Active Window Tracking**: Logs active window changes and the duration spent on each window.
- **Drive Sync**: Syncs local files to Google Drive, monitoring changes and updates in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Install the required modules:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up Google Drive API credentials:
    - Place your `credentials.json` file (obtained from Google API Console) in the project directory.

*STEPS TO DO SO*
To get the credentials.json file from the Google API Console, follow these steps:

Go to the Google API Console:

Visit Google API Console.
Create a new project (if you donâ€™t have one already):

Click on the project dropdown on the top left.
Click on "New Project."
Enter a name for your project and click "Create."
Enable the API you need:

Go to the "Library" in the left sidebar.
Search for the API you need (e.g., Google Drive API, Google Sheets API).
Click on the API and then click "Enable."
Create credentials:

Go to the "Credentials" tab in the left sidebar.
Click on "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs."
If prompted, configure the consent screen by providing the necessary information (app name, user support email, etc.).
Choose "Application type" based on your project (e.g., Desktop app, Web application).
Enter a name for your credentials and click "Create."
Download the credentials:

Once the credentials are created, you'll see a "Download" button. Click on it to download the credentials.json file.
Save this file in your project directory.
Use the credentials:

Place the credentials.json file in the directory where your application can access it.
